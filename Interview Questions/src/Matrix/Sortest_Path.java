/**

 Given a 2 dimensional matrix where some of the elements are filled with 1 and rest of the elements 
are filled. Here X means you cannot traverse to that particular points. From a cell you can either 
traverse to left, right, up or down Given two points in the matrix find the shortest path 
between these points 

For example if the matrix is 
1 1 1 1 1 
S 1 X 1 1 
1 1 1 1 1 
X 1 1 E 1 
1 1 1 1 X 

Here S is the starting point and E is the Ending point
